## Known Issues
- Sometimes the script will fail to initialize, especiallyÂ at the first time of page loading.
- After clicking the one-key rating button for 1-star items, the "Cancel" button on confirmation dialog may fail to function normally. You can cancel your decision by clicking the blank areas outside the dialog
- The script will fail to work on FireFox, and I don't know why. So please use Google Chrome with Tampermonkey.
